  `1. Create a React application that has multiple pages represented as components. Implement lazy loading for these components using React's lazy and Suspense features. When a user navigates to a particular page, the component should be loaded lazily, improving the application's initial loading time.`,
  `2. Extend Question 1 to include error handling. If a lazy-loaded component fails to load, display a user-friendly error message to the user instead of crashing the application. Implement this using the ErrorBoundary component.`,
